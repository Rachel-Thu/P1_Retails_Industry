## Key Business Insights

### Key Findings

- **Top-Performing Products:** Wi-Fi Router, Laptop, Security Camera, and Treadmill are leading contributors to sales.  
- **Underperforming Products:** Groceries Package A & B, Keyboard, Iron, and Electric Kettle show weak performance and require further analysis. 
- **Regional Performance Gaps:** Yangon (YGN) shows strong sales, while Mandalay (MDY) underperforms—indicating potential distribution or demand issues.
- **End-of-Year Sales Decline:** November and December report lower-than-expected sales, despite the typical seasonal uplift from holiday shopping.  
- **High-Performing Age Segments:** Customers aged 35–54 demonstrate the highest engagement and sales contribution.

### Recommendations

- **Maximize High Performers:** Ensure consistent stock and competitive pricing of top-selling items. Explore cross-selling opportunities (e.g., router + network extender).  
- **Revitalize Low Performers:** Bundle underperforming products with high-demand items. Collect customer feedback to uncover product-specific issues (e.g., price, awareness). 
- **Enhance Mandalay Region Strategy:** Investigate supply chain, promotions, and product fit for Mandalay; consider targeted campaigns.
- **Recover Year-End Sales:** Review previous campaign effectiveness; launch flash promotions to capture seasonal demand.  
- **Target Key Demographics:** Focus on the 35–54 age group with premium product offerings and tailored marketing strategies.

### Next Steps

- Conduct customer surveys to gain direct feedback  
- Launch promotional bundles and incentives
- Run region-specific campaigns for underperforming areas 
- Execute year-end promotional strategies
- Leverage targeted advertising based on age and product preferences
